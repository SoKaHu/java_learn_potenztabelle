# java_learn_potenztabelle
Learning Java part 1

This was coded as part of a TUM introduction in programming course.
The program is a UTF8-coded java file. The MiniJava file was provided by the chair of Algorithms and Complexity of TU Munich.


Instruction: 
Create a Latex-formatted chart. First of all, the program should ask the user for the size of the chart (n>0), which is then used for the rows and columns. 
If the user enters an unvalid number, he/she should be asked for another input. 
The chart should have the ij-1 value in the ith row and the jth column (rows and columns start with 1)

Note: You don't have to watch out for overflow. 
Note: Use the writeConsole("\\") for a single backslash (\).
